This is an On-The-Go Boiler Plate for backbone, marionette and require however I have used backbone localstorage, underscore, require text and jquery as they are often used with backbone, marionette and require project.
This boiler plate is based on MVC pattern using the marionette framework and It is used for front-end web development.

Note: This boiler plate doesnot have Cross-Browser Compatibility, So use Firefox for testing and development process or otherwise include cross browser compatibility to use with other browsers. It is not compatible with Google Chrome.
